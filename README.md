# Cpa
This is an implementation of a couple of algorithms taught by the SoSy Lab @LMU (https://www.sosy-lab.org/).
This implementation is trying to stick as close to the mathematical notation presented in the lectures,
it is not an efficient one or even idiomatic Lean. The purpose of this is merely to have an evaluator
for the algorithms, not an in any way solid real world implementation
